<!--I have a League stored in a Session so that I can persist my fantasy league-->
<!--When I navigate to /fantasy/teams I get an unordered list of team names from my league stored in a session-->
<!--Each team name is a link that sends me to /teams/<index in array>-->

<!--Update your POST route to persist the newly created Team to the League stored in the session, -->
<!--and to redirect to the /fantasy/teams index page upon creation of the team-->
<!--Feel free to reuse existing Thymeleaf templates to render the pages in question!-->
